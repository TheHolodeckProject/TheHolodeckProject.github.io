{"name":"UIUC Holodeck","tagline":"Where your dreams don't have to be dreams.","body":"### Welcome to the UIUC Holodeck!\r\nThrough a collaboration with the [Memory Systems Lab](http://msl.beckman.illinois.edu/), the [Decision Neuroscience Lab](http://decisionneurosciencelab.org/), and the [Lifelong Brain and Cognition Lab](http://lbc.beckman.illinois.edu/) at the [Beckman Institute](http://beckman.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/), (UIUC) the Holodeck project was created with the vision of taking advantage of the latest in off-the-shelf gaming technology in order to create more immersive and ecologically valid environments in which Training and Cognitive Testing could be developed. Through the use of the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/), [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/), [Microsoft Kinect](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect), and other virtual reality technologies, the Holodeck has become a place where your dreams can become reality.\r\n \r\n### People\r\nStarted in 2014, the UIUC Holodeck Project features some of the UIUC Neuroscience programs brightest engineers and scientists.
